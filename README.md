# HOI
1. Purpose:

Protects the homeowner’s investment in their property.

Lenders often require it to protect their interest in the mortgaged home.



2. Coverage Typically Includes:

Dwelling coverage: Repairs/rebuilding if the house is damaged (fire, storm, etc.).

Personal property: Protection for furniture, electronics, and personal items.

Liability: Covers accidents or injuries that happen on the property.

Additional living expenses: If you need temporary housing due to damage.



3. Mortgage Requirement:

Most US mortgage lenders require homeowners insurance as a condition of the loan.

The lender is often listed as a “mortgagee” on the policy to protect their financial interest.



4. Difference From Flood Insurance:

HOI does not typically cover flooding; flood insurance is usually separate.

Flood insurance may also be required by lenders if the property is in a flood-prone area.
